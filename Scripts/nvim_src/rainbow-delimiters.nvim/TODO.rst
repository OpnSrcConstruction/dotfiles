Built-in queries
################

As of version 0.8.3 Neovim can only match one node per query.  This is a
limitation of Neovim and there is nothing that can be done on this end.

The global query does not updated the highlighting of injected languages.

===========================

I do not know enough about the following languages in order to write good
queries.  Contributions are welcome.

- devicetree
- elixir
- elm
- fish
- gdscript
- graphql
- hcl
- kotlin
- meson
