# You can use before_script to run a script before the tmux session starts building.
# This can be used to start a script to create a virtualenvor
# or download a virtualenv/rbenv/package.
# json’s dependency files before tmuxp even begins building the session.
#
# It works by using the Exit Status code returned by a script. Your script can be any type, including bash, python, ruby, etc.
#
# A successful script will exit with a status of 0.
#
# Important: the script file must be chmod executable +x or 755.
#
# Run a python script (and check for it’s return code),
# the script is relative to the .tmuxp.yaml’s root
# (Windows and panes omitted in this example):
#
session_name: my session
before_script: ./bootstrap.py
# ... the rest of your workspace
#
# OR...
#
session_name: another example
before_script: /absolute/path/this.sh # abs path to shell script
# finish the layout...
