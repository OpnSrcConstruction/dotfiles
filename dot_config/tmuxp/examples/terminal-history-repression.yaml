# tmuxp allows suppress_history: false to override the default command / suppression when building the workspace.
# This will add the shell_command to the shell history in the pane.
# The suppression of the shell_command commands from the shellâ€™s history occurs by prefixing the commands with a space when suppress_history: true.
# Accordingly, this functionality depends on the shell being appropriately configured:
# bash requires the shell variable HISTCONTROL to be set and include either of the values ignorespace or ignoreboth
# (to also ignore sequential duplicate commands), and zsh requires setopt HIST_IGNORE_SPACE.
